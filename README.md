7.  Are strings mutable in Javascript ?
    No, strings in Js are immutable , meaning their characters cannot be modified once created.

8.  If strings are immutable , how can they be assigned ?

16. Difference between == and ===?
    == -> compares the value after type conversion (checks only value )
    === -> compares both value and type 

17. What are truthy and falsy values ? 
    Falsy values :- null , undefined , "",0 and NaN.
    All other values are truthy.

18.
